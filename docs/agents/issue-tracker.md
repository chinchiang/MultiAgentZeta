# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and specs for this repo live as GitHub issues in `chinchiang/MultiAgentZeta`. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --json number,title,body,labels,comments`.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'` with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Make an issue a sub-issue of a parent**: `gh issue create --parent <parent> ...`, or `gh issue edit <parent> --add-sub-issue <child>` afterwards.
- **Blocking**: GitHub's **native issue dependencies**, the canonical, UI-visible representation. Add an edge with `gh issue create --blocked-by <n>,<n> ...` or `gh issue edit <child> --add-blocked-by <blocker>`. A ticket is unblocked when every blocker is closed.
- **Count open blockers**: `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n> --jq .issue_dependencies_summary.blocked_by` (open blockers only; 0 means startable). `gh issue view <n> --json blockedBy` also lists closed blockers, so filter it: `--jq '[.blockedBy.nodes[] | select(.state == "OPEN")] | length'`.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close**: post the explanation with `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`, then `gh issue close <number>`. On an already-closed issue, `gh issue close --comment` drops the comment and still exits 0.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** _(Set to `yes` if this repo treats external PRs as feature requests; `/triage` reads this flag. The `gh pr` commands for `yes` are in the `setup-matt-pocock-skills` template.)_

GitHub shares one number space across issues and PRs, so a bare `#42` may be either: resolve with `gh pr view 42` and fall back to `gh issue view 42`.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitHub issue in this repo's ticket format:

- **Title**: `v0.1-NN：<正體中文標題>`, numbered after the last existing ticket.
- **Body sections**, in order: `## Parent` (the spec issue, e.g. `#1`), `## What to build`, `## Acceptance criteria` (checkbox list), `## 對應條文` (the `TK-` numbers).
- Cite requirements by `TK-` number; the spec is authoritative, so the issue carries the number, not the requirement text.
- Before publishing, read the spec text of every requirement listed in `## 對應條文`, and check each acceptance criterion against it: a criterion is stricter, looser or different from its requirement only when the ticket says why. Drafts from earlier sessions or handoffs are the usual source of a mismatch.
- Write the body in 正體中文, using `GLOSSARY.md` terms.
- Link the ticket to its parent as a sub-issue and add its blockers as native dependencies.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Read it as in **Read an issue** above.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a single issue with **child** issues as tickets.

- **Map**: a single issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body. `gh issue create --label wayfinder:map`.
- **Child ticket**: an issue linked to the map as a GitHub sub-issue (see **Make an issue a sub-issue of a parent**). Labels: `wayfinder:<type>` (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`). Once claimed, the ticket is assigned to the driving dev.
- **Blocking**: see **Blocking** under Conventions.
- **Frontier query**: list the map's open children (`gh issue list --state open`, scoped to the map's sub-issues), drop any with an open blocker (see **Count open blockers**) or an assignee; first in map order wins.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me`, the session's first write.
- **Resolve**: `gh issue comment <n> --body "<answer>"`, then `gh issue close <n>`, then append a context pointer (gist + link) to the map's Decisions-so-far.
